## About
This is a password generator. You should be able to select whether or not to include numbers, symbols, uppercase, and lowercase letters. The password must be between 8 and 128 characters long. This project was challenging for me. This was my first time attemping to take all the elements I know and tie them together in a meaningful way. I found this way to make the most logical sense to me.
